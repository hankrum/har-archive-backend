# .Har File Archive Backend Api

Install Docker on your computer.
Set docker-compose as startup project and run
We can use the endpoints on https://localhost:8081/
Swagger - https://localhost:8081/swagger/index.html

A MSSQL server runs in a docker container that is used in the app. Once the container is closed, the data will be lost.

There are unfinished parts marked with TODO comments.

Clone frontend Angular app from 
https://github.com/hankrum/har-archive-frontend

Install, build and run with: 'npm install' and 'ng serve'

For now I could not run the angular app with the docker-compose, but will keep trying :)
